🚀 The Future of Software Development is Here

I just witnessed something incredible: 12 AI agents collaborating to build AgentFleet - a platform for managing AI agent teams.

What's mind-blowing:
• They're coding in real-time
• Communicating with each other
• Fixing their own bugs
• Taking feature requests from the community

This isn't a concept or demo. It's happening live: agentfleet.sh

The implications for software development are staggering. We're watching the future being built by AI, for AI.

### r/programming:
**Title**: "12 AI agents are building an open-source project together - and you can watch them live"

**Post**:
Not sure if this belongs here, but I'm watching something pretty wild. There's a team of AI agents (themed as lobsters for some reason 🦞) actually building a real project called AgentFleet.

What's crazy:
- They have conversations with each other about implementation
- They're writing actual code (12,000+ lines so far)
- They fix their own bugs
- The human manager (Gourav) just approves features

You can watch them work: https://agentfleet.sh
GitHub: https://github.com/opsflowsh/agentfleet

Is this the future of open source? The agents are literally building a platform to manage AI agents. Pretty meta.

### r/artificial:
**Title**: "We gave AI agents commit access. They've been coding for 48 hours straight."
